Task Title:
TO-DO App Development


Task Description:
Development of a TO-DO App with features for adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed or pending, and saving tasks locally using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Steps Taken:

1. Planning:
. Defined the structure of the TO-DO app.
. Decided on the features to include (add, edit, delete, mark as completed/pending, and local storage).

2. HTML:
. Created the basic structure of the app.
. Included an input field and a button for adding tasks.
. Added a list to display tasks.

3. CSS:
. Styled the app for a clean and user-friendly interface.
. Ensured the app is responsive and visually appealing.

4. JavaScript:
. Implemented functionality to add tasks to the DOM.
. Added features for editing, deleting, and toggling the status of tasks.
. Used local storage to save and load tasks.


Challenges Faced:

1. Understanding Local Storage:
. Difficulty in figuring out how to save and retrieve tasks from local storage.

2. Event Listeners:
. Handling multiple event listeners (edit, delete, and status change) for dynamic elements.


Solutions Implemented:

1. Local Storage:
. Read through documentation and tutorials on local storage.
. Implemented functions to save tasks to and load tasks from local storage.

2. Event Listeners:
. Utilized event delegation to handle events on dynamically created elements.
. Ensured event listeners are added appropriately when new tasks are created.


Learnings:

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript Integration:
. Learned how to effectively integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional web application.

2. Local Storage:
. Gained a better understanding of how to use local storage to persist data between sessions.

3. Dynamic DOM Manipulation:
. Improved skills in dynamically manipulating the DOM using JavaScript.


Project Update:

The TO-DO app is now functional with the following features:

. Users can add new tasks through an input field.
. Each task can be edited, deleted, and marked as completed or pending.
. Tasks are saved to local storage, allowing users to maintain their task list between sessions.
